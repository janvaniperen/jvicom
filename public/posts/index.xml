      <description>&lt;p&gt;I tried a citrus focused newsletter some time ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe I was too early, or just missed a couple of essential building blocks to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing I did learn is that sometimes, how you have it in your head does not necessarily reflect similarly with your audience. I learned much more and that is why I am building something much better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-in-a-name&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s in a name?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I called that first rendition &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;citreae&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and quickly learned that it is quite the disadvantage when you have to help people pronounce or even write the name of your service.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;rsquo;m bored&amp;hellip; I need to create. And my creative process is usually linked to building something: a new design, a website or the framework for a full-scale solution to a world problem.&#xA;Think big, start small.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It usually comes down to this: I have an idea, I draw an outline, buy a domain, desing a logo, start building a website&amp;hellip;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;1 Problem though: Too many projects never leave &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I created a Hugo theme: MNML</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Weird, but there are products that you &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to use just for the sake of using them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is the way a pen feels in your hand and interacts with the paper, the way the lid closes of a hand-crafted wooden storage box, perfectly and with a pause before a satisfying click, the way my wallet slides out my credit cards evenly spread out with one move of the top of my pink.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Juice News v7.1</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In all honesty: I did not really keep track of the major version updates&amp;hellip; but this feels about right. Let&amp;rsquo;s call this &lt;code&gt;version 7&lt;/code&gt; of Juice News. Lucky number Seven. And from now on I&amp;rsquo;ll try to share proper and &lt;strong&gt;regular&lt;/strong&gt; changelogs&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;10-years-of-juice-news&#34;&gt;10 Years of Juice News&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 7th of 2024 marked the exact date that Juice News celebrated its 10th anniversary.&lt;/strong&gt; The result of a (mostly) continuous flow of sifting through hundreds of news items, articles and research publications&amp;hellip; on a daily basis. A habit that has become part of my life.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I am not somebody who gets emotional about this, but I did sit back for a sec and realized it is something I am doing for more that a fifth of my life. And yes, I am proud of that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
