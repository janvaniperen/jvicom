<p>In all honesty: I did not really keep track of the major version updates&hellip; but this feels about right. Let&rsquo;s call this <code>version 7</code> of Juice News. Lucky number Seven. And from now on I&rsquo;ll try to share proper and <strong>regular</strong> changelogs&hellip;</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="10-years-of-juice-news">10 Years of Juice News</h2>
<p><strong>November 7th of 2024 marked the exact date that Juice News celebrated its 10th anniversary.</strong> The result of a (mostly) continuous flow of sifting through hundreds of news items, articles and research publications&hellip; on a daily basis. A habit that has become part of my life.<br>
I am not somebody who gets emotional about this, but I did sit back for a sec and realized it is something I am doing for more that a fifth of my life. And yes, I am proud of that.</p>
<p>Juice News started as a simple newsletter, sent out to a small group of friends and colleagues. It was a way to share the news I found interesting and relevant. Over the years, the audience grew and the content evolved. From a simple list of links to a more curated selection of articles, with summaries and impact. The reach grew and the connection with the readers became an unexpected and very welcome side effect. It has opened doors, created opportunities and has been a source of inspiration and motivation.</p>
<h3 id="consistency">Consistency</h3>
<p>When it comes to the frontend of Juice News, there are two main &ldquo;faces&rdquo;: The newsletter and the website. Further there are irregular outings on LinkedIn and on X (formerly known as Twitter), but it is the newsletter that remains the most consistent: relatively simple, clean and easy to consume. In a format that mostly saw some changes in layout and design, yet in general is very close to what it looked like in the very beginning.</p>
<p>The other thing about the newsletter, and nowadays the website, is the regularity. Although I am even more critical about this than most of my readers (I feel properly bad when I miss a day or even a week. Due to many travels and more busy-ness, that feeling was fed multiple times in the last 12 months. But&hellip; that also drove more development, a quest for higher efficiency and efficacy. Mostly it was a stimulus to secure the consistency.</p>
<p>The past weeks especially, I worked on redoing the curation flow, adding more automation and improving the summaries. The result is a more efficient and effective way of curating the news, with better summaries and more accurate selection of articles.</p>
<h3 id="automation-and-platform">Automation and Platform</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s dive into this workflow a bit deeper. It consists of 2 elements: curation and publishing.</p>
<p>Since about 6 years I am using a self developed tool, coined <a href="https://wrample.com">wrample</a> to super quickly and accurately curate the news I deem worthy of my newsletter. Thanks to some automated help (read ChatGPT and other AI-based tools), I&rsquo;ve been able – even with my very basic coding skills – to further optimize and streamline this tool. Even to the point that – should there be a window of time large enough to execute on this – I may turn this into a service for others.</p>
<p>The other tool is purely focused on getting the updates of all the different sources and news outlets, making it easier to digest hundreds of news articles on a daily basis. The list of resources has grown over the years, and the tool has facilitated for me to keep up.</p>
<p>For the publication part, I migrated the newsletter&rsquo;s and website&rsquo;s tech stack from a customized collection of different solutions to 1 single platform: <a href="https://www.beehiiv.com?via=janvaniperen">Beehiiv</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> .
Main reason is that this platform has many elements built in, updates its efficacy on a regular basis and it has a community  that helps and supports its user base really well.</p>
<h3 id="monetization">Monetization</h3>
<p>For the past 2-3 years I have dabbled with various ways of monetizing this newsletter. It has become a publication with an audience way beyond juices and beverages. The time and effort going into this medium has fluctuated: Each time new elements and resources are added, it takes time before I can adjust, improve and/or automate my new work flow.
Sifting through 100&rsquo;s of sources and hand-picking <strong>the right</strong> articles is something that I cannot put in an AI model, <em>yet</em>.</p>
<p>During this year&rsquo;s (2024) International Citrus and Beverage Conference in Clearwater, FL, it was the perfect moment for me to connect with my readers. And while being humbled by the amount of flattery and praise for my efforts curating the news over all these years, I managed to gather valuable feedback.</p>
<p>The most essential feedback was a question: How can we get mentioned in the newsletter? Can we sponsor a week or put a job opening in a couple editions?</p>
<p>It led to a big change:</p>
<h3 id="growth">Growth</h3>
<p>To better understand why I am making a change, it is important to understand what happened to Juice News over the past 18 months:</p>
<h3 id="added-value">Added Value</h3>

<p>With the changes made in my monetization model, of which the outcome is still to be seen, I still have a very very loyal group of readers I want to support and stimulate. 2 things that I have been working on for them are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Citrus One</strong>: A premium service for those who want to get more out of Juice News. This service includes access to a citrus-focused custom GPT, a weekly deep dive into a specific topic and a monthly ebook with the most important news of the month.</li>
