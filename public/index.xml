And my creative process is usually linked to building something: a new design, a website or the framework for a full-scale solution to a world problem.
Think big, start small.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It usually comes down to this: I have an idea, I draw an outline, buy a domain, desing a logo, start building a website&amp;hellip;&lt;br>
1 Problem though: Too many projects never leave &lt;code>localhost&lt;/code>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I created a Hugo theme: MNML</title><link>https://janvaniperen.com/posts/created-mnml-hugo-theme/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://janvaniperen.com/posts/created-mnml-hugo-theme/</guid><description>&lt;p>Weird, but there are products that you &lt;em>want&lt;/em> to use just for the sake of using them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is the way a pen feels in your hand and interacts with the paper, the way the lid closes of a hand-crafted wooden storage box, perfectly and with a pause before a satisfying click, the way my wallet slides out my credit cards evenly spread out with one move of the top of my pink.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Privacy Policy</title><link>https://janvaniperen.com/pages/privacy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://janvaniperen.com/pages/privacy/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with my name: &lt;strong>Jan 🗣️ [&lt;em>Yahnn&lt;/em>]&lt;/strong>&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s a Dutch thing. &lt;em>&lt;strong>Jay&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> is also fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A little about me: Dutch guy, born in the year of the Apple I (1976), happily married to Bee, proud father of 3 boys and active in food supply chains for the past 25 years. Mostly as intermediary between producers (those transforming fruits and vegetables into juices, concentrates, purees, oils and essences) and those active in the ingredients industry (who use these half products to make new ingredients, compounds or who bottle the product for consumer consumption).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Juice News</title><link>https://janvaniperen.com/projects/juice-news/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://janvaniperen.com/projects/juice-news/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="overview">Overview&lt;/h2>
