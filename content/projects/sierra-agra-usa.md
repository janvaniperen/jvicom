## Company
Sierra Agra USA transforms the "unseen harvest"[^1]—culled, rejected, or cosmetically imperfect produce—into a diverse portfolio of juices, purees, concentrates, and by-products, addressing a critical yet often overlooked issue in California's Central Valley.

[^1]: I discovered this term while researching our marketing and branding copy, and it resonates deeply. It perfectly captures the scale and significance of a problem that deserves more attention.

## Roles

### Advisor to the Board, Marketing Consultant (July 2022 – July 2024)
Drawing on my experience as a broker in the juice and beverage industry, I joined Sierra Agra USA in July 2022 as an advisor to the board, focusing on sales and marketing. I collaborated closely with the C-suite to shape the company’s positioning and marketing strategy, leveraging my industry network and expertise built through **indupro** and my authority grown through **Juice News** .

### VP of Business Development (August 2024 – April 2025)
In 2024, it became clear I could make a greater impact by joining the team on the West Coast. After thoughtful discussions, my family and I relocated to Visalia, California, and I transitioned into the role of VP of Business Development, based at the Fowler facility. This marked my return to being an employee for the first time in over 25 years.

## Startup Realities
The thrill of working in a startup brings unparalleled experience and opportunity, but it also comes with uncertainty. A startup’s path can be shaped by many unpredictable factors. In April 2025, my journey with Sierra Agra USA concluded due to economic circumstances. While I respect the business decisions made, I cannot share further details.

## Reflections
My time at Sierra Agra USA was a rewarding chapter, filled with growth and challenges. I remain passionate about the mission to transform the unseen harvest and am grateful for the opportunity to have contributed to such an innovative venture.
