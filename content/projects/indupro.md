indupro connects people in the ingredients industry. Old-school networking and brokering skills meet technology and marketing leverage.

The company is owned and run by Jan van Iperen, a Dutch entrepreneur with 25 years of experience in the citrus, juice and beverage industry, who currently works and resides in California.

## History

indupro (industrial products) was established by Mr. John van Iperen, my late father. Continuing his experience working with his uncle August Dubru and after growing the export network for the Cutrale family since 1966, John initiates indupro as a trader/broker/agent firm in Rotterdam.

In 2001, triggered by what been spoon-fed to me from a young age, I join my father's company, part-time. While still at another part-time job, I start to explore the ingredients, juice and citrus industry, and slowly get caught by the "virus" I saw with my father. 

After learning the ropes, the knowledge and network for 7 years, I indicated to my parents my interest to take over the family business.  
That led - after a gradual takeover — to becoming owner of indupro in 2012.

Ever since, while continuing to grow my network, I have helped hundred of people to purchase or sell their ingredients, to optimize their position in the supply chain, and to improve their marketing and branding endeavors.
