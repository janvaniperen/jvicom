Weird, but there are products that you *want* to use just for the sake of using them.

It is the way a pen feels in your hand and interacts with the paper, the way the lid closes of a hand-crafted wooden storage box, perfectly and with a pause before a satisfying click, the way my wallet slides out my credit cards evenly spread out with one move of the top of my pink.

I wanted that for this space, for my personal spot on the interwebs. 

And now, with some help from Cursor I was able to build the website that I would want to use daily: Simple, clean, with a hidden layer of convenience.

That's how MNML was created.

## Introduction

Welcome to MNML, a minimalist Hugo theme designed for content-focused websites. This theme emphasizes readability and simplicity, making it perfect for blogs, portfolios, and personal websites.

## Features

MNML comes with several features that enhance your content while maintaining a clean, distraction-free design:

### Typography

The theme uses a carefully selected typography system that prioritizes readability across different devices and screen sizes.

### Dark Mode

A built-in dark mode toggle allows readers to choose their preferred reading experience.

### Table of Contents

For longer posts, you can enable a table of contents that helps readers navigate through your content.

### Keyboard Navigation

And last but not least: I wanted to be able to navigate through my site without touching a mouse. Hit <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>?</kbd> and you quickly learn the basics.

## Conclusion

MNML provides a clean foundation for my content while offering the flexibility to customize as needed. Its minimalist approach ensures that readers can focus on what matters most: the content.
