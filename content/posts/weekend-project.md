When I'm bored... I need to create. And my creative process is usually linked to building something: a new design, a website or the framework for a full-scale solution to a world problem.
Think big, start small.

It usually comes down to this: I have an idea, I draw an outline, buy a domain, desing a logo, start building a website...  
1 Problem though: Too many projects never leave `localhost`.

Years ago, I would draw, reach the limitations of my drawing and artistic scales and would leave it there.

Then I started using a computer, learned using tools like Illustrator, Gimp and Photoshop. Suddenly my accuracy in drawing reached a new level and I could achieve results in design and illustration that were way closer to what I had in my mind.

When I learned the basics of web web design, the workings of databases, static and dynamic content, therefor I made yet another leap in converting ideas and structures in my head, into actual working results.

But there were still hurdles, complexities for which I understood what was required, but my skillset did not allow for creating the solutions. I learned more about coding, frontend and backend, databases and payment gateways... but bringing it all together was still a reach.

## Vibes

And then came AI. In the conversational phase, I could shape my ideas, refine the elements and descriptions, and even validate parts, while stacking an idea against existing similar results in other settings, other industries.

And now we are vibe coding... we go from a list style description to a refined brief for 1 tool that converts an idea in words into a fully functional and shippable product.

I am in shock and almost do not know what shelved project I have to choose first: I suddenly can use all the writing I did around each idea and convert it to reality.

So here we go. Back to weekend creation madness mode; trying to be selective and prioritizing which idea to convert to a working, converting and yielding project.

The parameters:

- must be related to areas that pique my interest:
  - Juice & Beverage industry
  - Ag & Agtech
  - Upcycling
  - GLP-1
  - 2nd half life (50+ yr old population)
- must be fully functional
- must have an impact
- when SAAS: for the long term
- when non-SAAS, must have monetization element to fuel sale

Expect updates of progress, soon.
