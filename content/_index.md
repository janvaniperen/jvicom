#### Connecting and informing people, mostly in food supply chains

## Hi, I'm Jan  
— pronounced *Yahnn*, it's a Dutch thing.

I'm a consultant and intermediary in the juice and citrus industry, and love evangelizing organizations and products that – impactfully – go against the grain in food and ag(tech). I tinker with code & no-code, and publish niche industry newsletters.
