## About Me

Let's start with my name: **Jan üó£Ô∏è [*Yahnn*]**... it's a Dutch thing. ***Jay*** is also fine.

A little about me: Dutch guy, born in the year of the Apple I (1976), happily married to Bee, proud father of 3 boys and active in food supply chains for the past 25 years. Mostly as intermediary between producers (those transforming fruits and vegetables into juices, concentrates, purees, oils and essences) and those active in the ingredients industry (who use these half products to make new ingredients, compounds or who bottle the product for consumer consumption).

Since a couple of years that position - as broker - has been complemented with various roles as business developer, interim sales manager, advisor or consultant.

Through broad interest, inspiration from encounters with bright minds, I skilled myself in curating industry news (within niches I am familiar with) and publishing corresponding content, online and through **newsletters**. It has grown my reach and authority since 2014 and taught me a lot: in communications, in automation, in software development and in adding value for others. Karma is strong with this one...

## Motto
### *"Stay Curious, Look over the Fence and Listen to Evidence that Contradicts your Beliefs."*

How I keep myself standing in life is quite simple: I believe I can learn from anyone. I believe I can learn from any situation. I do not believe that what I know and have experienced is either right or wrong, or a truth set in stone. The motto - as stated here above - is one that strengthens me, keeps me alert and inquisitive, and that yields the most interesting and inspiring conversations.

In my opinion, ***confirmation bias*** is one of the most elementary blockers in anyone's development. So I am aware of it and bend it to my will, make the opposite my forte.
